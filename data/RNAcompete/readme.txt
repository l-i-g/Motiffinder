data from https://github.com/morrislab/RNAcompete

raw_data: The input file of the analysis is named raw_data.txt. The first column of raw_data.txt indicates the probe ID, and microarray data for each RBP is listed in two columns: one consists of quantified fluorescence signals captured in TIFF images, and the "FLAG" column indicates "poor quality" spots in microarray.
probes: links probes to sequences
sets: probes are organized in two sets
